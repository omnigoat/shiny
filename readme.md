# Shiny

Shiny is a graphics engine written in Directx 11. It is ostensibly general-purpose, but so far has only implemented just enough to render voxels.

## Features

* Modern C++11 practices! Written by a experienced games-industry dev-type person!
* It's written with a solid knowledge of DXGI and DirectX 11. Since it's quite young, the big DirectX 12 decision needs to be made.
* That's it. That's all the features.

## Dependencies

It's dependant on two other projects, `atma` and `fooey`. Deal with it.

## Installation

I mean just clone it? It's Windows-only, so you probably have Visual Studio (`project/shiny.sln`).
